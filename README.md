## A box for misfit toys [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeaye/toybox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeaye/toybox)

This is a repo for projects which aren't intended to be used in production.
Maybe, some day, one of these projects will be adopted into its own repo; for
now, these misfit toys are all welcome here.
